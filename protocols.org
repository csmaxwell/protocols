Taken from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology cite:lech2001, adapted to Burch Lab protocol.

1. Grow culture of /E. coli/ to saturation in [[lambda-media][λMM]] (e.g. overnight or 4h).
2. Pre-warm [[lambda-media][lambda plates]] to room temperature.
3. Pipet 2.5ml of top agar into 5ml glass tubes, incubate at 48C.
   - Pre-warm the glass tubes before pipeting.
   - Loosen tube caps while they're warming for ease of handling.
   - Heat the glass pipet before pipeting.
   - Ensure the caps are on tightly to prevent cooling.
4. Make serial dilutions of phage stock in [[smg][SMG]]
   - Dilutions should be 30 µL into 300 µL (e.g. 1:10)
   - Plate lysis should give ~1e10pfu/ml, liquid lysis should give
     5e9-3e10pfu/ml.
5. Pipet 0.3ml of /E. coli/ culture into 0.7ml epitubes.
6. Add 0.1ml of the phage dilutions to the tubes containing the /E. coli/ cells.
7. Incubate for 20min at room temperature to allow binding.
8. Move to 37C for 10 minutes to allow injection of DNA.
9. Add the phage+bacteria to the top agar, rub between hands,
   spread on plate by pouring, then gently swirling.
   - Note: For accurate count, rock top agar over to the side and add
     the cells + phage directly to the top agar
10. Make a control plate with bacteria only by adding 0.3ml of
    bacteria to 2.5ml top agar.
11. Let the top agar set for 15min at room temperature.
12. Incubate at 37C for 6-8h for counting, 12h for picking.

    :VERSION:  1.0
    :UPDATED:  <2018-03-12 Mon>
    :END:
The goal of this is to determine the lysis time and burst size of T7. 

1) The night before, make 12ml of saturated E. coli (e.g. BL21).
2) Put 50ml of LB into another baffled flask and shake at 37C.
3) Prepare ~25 top agar tubes
4) Warm ~25 plates of LB to room temperature
5) Prepare 3 1.5ml epi tubes with a small amount of chlor
6) Set a heat block to 37C
7) Back-dilute 200-300uL of saturated culture into a 50ml baffled
   flask with 10ml LB. Put in the shaker at 200rpm at 37C until cells
   reach an OD of 0.125 ~ 1e8 cells.
8) Add ~1e7 phage (MOI of 0.1) directly to the flask with the cells, put them back shaking at 37C.
9) Start timer
10) While the phage are binding, make aliquots of LB into 15ml falcon tubes and place them on the 37C heat block:
    1) 9ml (for the 1e1 culture)
    2) 9.9ml (for the 1e-3 culture)
    3) 9ml (for the 1e-4 culture)
    4) 9ml (for the 1e-5 culture)
11) After 5 minutes, make the following dilutions:
    1) 1ml cells + 9ml pre-warmed LB
    2) 100ul of cells from (2) into 9.9ml LB -> -3
    3) 1ml of cells from (3) into 9ml LB -> -4
    4) 1ml of cells from (4) into 9ml LB -> -5
12) Immediately take 1ml x3 of the 1e3 culture and put it in each of the tubes with chloroform. Vortex briefly. This should be before 6:30 on the timer.
13) Collect samples as quickly as possible:

| Dilution | Time                           |
|----------+--------------------------------|
| -3       | Before 11 minutes              |
| -3/-4    | From 11-13 minutes             |
| -4/-5    | From 13-16 minutes             |
| -5       | From 16 minutes to ~22 minutes |

14) Plate 250-500 ul of the chloroform samples
15) Grow all plates 3h at 37C, then count.

*** Adsorption assay

- Day 1

1) Innoculate cells overnight to get saturated culture in LB
2) Ensure you have XX plates of LB per sample and sufficient

- Day 2

2) Back dilute cells into 20ml LB, shake at 37C
   - 540ul of MG1655 per 20ml
   - 480ul of B WT per 20ml
3) Shake until culture reaches OD 0.125 = 1e8 cells/ml
4) Add

There seems to be some dispute about how much glycerol to add to the
phage stocks. I am going to use 50% glycerol, final concentration.

1. Lyse cells using either plate lysis or liquid lysis
2. Add a few drops of chloroform and invert a few times to kill
   remaining cells.
3. Incubate for 5min at room temperature
4. Spin out the cell lysate and chloroform 2min at 10,000 x g
5. Remove supernatant for freezing.
6. Dilute 1:5 into SMG if the lysate is in LB media.
7. Add glycerol and store at -20C for short term or -80C for long-term storage.
   - Add 0.62ml of 80% glycerol, 0.38ml of lysate to get 50% glycerol
