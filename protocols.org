Lambda adsorbs best when cells are grown in the presence of Maltose and MgS04, so cells are grown in lambda broth + 10mM MgS04 + 0.2% Maltose (λMM).

| lambda broth      | 30ml  |
| 20% maltose       | 3ml   |

** Plate counts
*** <<lambda-count>> Counting Lambda plaques
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UPDATED:  <2018-02-06 Tue>
    :VERSION:  1.0
    :END:

Taken from Current Protocols in Molecular Biology cite:lech2001, adapted to Burch Lab protocol.

1. Grow culture of /E. coli/ to saturation in [[lambda-media][λMM]] (e.g. overnight or 4h).
2. Pre-warm [[lambda-media][lambda plates]] to 37C, ensure there's no visible moisture
   on the plates. Dry if needed.
3. Pipet 2.5ml of top agar into 5ml glass tubes, incubate at 48C.
   - Pre-warm the glass tubes before pipeting.
   - Loosen tube caps while they're warming for ease of handling.
   - Heat the glass pipet before pipeting.
   - Ensure the caps are on tightly to prevent cooling.
4. Make serial dilutions of phage stock in [[smg][SMG]]
   - Usually 1:100 is used. Plate lysis should give ~1e10pfu/ml, liquid
      lysis should give 5e9-3e10pfu/ml.
5. Pipet 0.3ml of /E. coli/ culture into 0.7ml epitubes.
6. Add 0.1ml of the phage dilutions to the tubes containing the /E. coli/ cells.
7. Incubate for 20min at room temperature to allow binding.
8. Move to 37C for 10 minutes to allow injection of DNA.
9. Add the phage+bacteria to the top agar, vortex gently (setting 3),
   spread on plate by pouring, then gently swirling.
10. Make a control plate with bacteria only by adding 0.3ml of
    bacteria to 2.5ml top agar.
11. Let the top agar set for 15min at room temperature.
12. Incubate at 37C for 6-8h for counting, 12h for picking.

Taken from cite:Manfioletti1988wv. 

1. Grow /E. coli/ overnight 30C in [[lambda-media][λMM]]
2. Spin down at 1000g for 10 minutes, resuspend in 0.5 volumes of 10mM MgS04
3. Mix 0.3ml of cells with 1000pfu on Lambda. Incubate at 37C for 15min.
4. Mix with 3ml of [[lambda-media][lambda top agar]] and pour onto [[lambda-media][lambda plate]].
5. Set the top agar for 15min.
6. Incubate at 37C for 8-10h until the plaques are confluent.
7. Add 3ml of of [[smg][SMG]], leave overnight at 4C with gentle rocking.
8. Collect lysate, add 1/50 volume of chloroform.
9. Shake and centrifuge for 2 minutes at 5000g.
10. Store at 4C.

Should get >1e11 pfu.

*** <<t7-count>> Counting T7 plaques
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UPDATED:  <2018-02-06 Tue>
    :VERSION:  1.0
    :END:

1. Grow culture of /E. coli/ to saturation in [[lb-media][LB]] (e.g. overnight or 4h).
2. Proceed as with [[lambda-counts][lambda plate counts]], except use LB, and don't
   pre-adsorb to the bacteria. Just add the phage and the bacteria to
   the top agar and go.
3. Plaques can be counted after 3-4hr.

*** <<t7-plaque>> Picking a T7 plaque
    :PROPERTIES:
    :UPDATED:  <2018-02-06 Tue>
    :VERSION:  1.0
    :END:

1. Sterilize a razor blade by spraying it with 70% ETOH and flaming.
2. Use it to cut a 200µL pipet tip about 1/3 of the way up.
3. Cut out the plaque using the tip and transfer to 300µL of [[smg][SMG]].
4. Vortex gently, incubate for 20minutes or overnight at 4C.
5. Add a few drops of chloroform, shake, centrifuge for 2minutes at 5000xg.
